<h5>At BSCIT WALLAH, we are dedicated to delivering high-quality web development services that meet and exceed our clients' expectations. We understand that circumstances might arise where a refund is requested. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions and procedures for requesting a refund.</h5>
        
<h4>Eligibility for Refunds:</h4>
<p>1.1. Deposit for Projects: A non-refundable deposit is required before starting a project. This deposit secures your place in our development queue and covers initial administrative and planning work.</p>
        
<p>1.2. Project Milestone Payments: For projects that involve multiple milestones, refunds for milestone payments will be considered under the following conditions:</p>
        
<p>If the client cancels the project before the work for a specific milestone has begun, a refund for that milestone may be issued.
        Once work for a milestone has started, the payment for that milestone is non-refundable.</p>
    <h4>Refund Process:</h4>
<p> 2.1. Refund Request: To initiate a refund request, please contact our customer support team at <a href="bscit.wallah.query@bw.com"style="text-decoration:none;">Gmail</a> and provide the relevant details, including the reason for the refund and any supporting documentation.</p>
        
<p>2.2. Approval and Processing: Refund requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Once approved, the refund will be processed within 48 hours. Refunds will be made using the original method of payment.</p>
        
<h4>Non-Refundable Items and Services:</h4>
<p>3.1. Custom Development Work: Payments for custom development work, including coding, design, and programming services, are non-refundable once the work has been initiated.</p>
        
    <p> 3.2. Hosting and Domain Fees: Hosting fees, domain registration fees, and related services are non-refundable as they are paid to third-party providers.</p>
        
    <h4>Project Cancellation:</h4>
    <p>4.1. If the client wishes to cancel a project after it has commenced, the portion of the project not completed will be assessed, and a partial refund may be considered based on the amount of work completed.</p>
        
        <p>Dissatisfaction or Revisions:</p>
        <p>5.1. If you are dissatisfied with the quality of the work, please contact us within 7 days of project completion. We will review the concerns and, if necessary, provide revisions to address the issues.</p>
